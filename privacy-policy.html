Personal information is information about you, your users or your clients that is personally identifiable like name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

By using this Website, you are expressly consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as described.

Your visit to this Site is voluntary and it is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity online.

In addition, depending on the products and/or services purchased, content, such as images and video, or other data required for such product/services will also be collected. Data, used in reporting or marketing, may also be necessarily collected. If there are any postings, comments, feedback, event registrations or sweepstakes entries you make or voluntarily enter personal information for, this information will also be collected and become our property and we reserve the right to use such material with your personal information for any reason.</p>

                                        <p>You may review and modify the personal information we have collected by contacting us at info@solodev.com.</p>

                        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
